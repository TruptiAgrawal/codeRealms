### Project: CodeRealms Implementation - Phase 1 Report

**Objective:** To implement the "Achievement Badge System" as outlined in the project's implementation plan.

**Summary of Work:**

I have successfully implemented the core features of the Achievement Badge System, including both backend and frontend components. The system is now functional and integrated into the existing application.

**Backend Implementation:**

*   **Data Models:**
    *   Created `Achievement` and `UserAchievement` models in Mongoose to store achievement data and user progress.
*   **Achievement Service:**
    *   Developed a dedicated `AchievementService` to encapsulate the logic for checking and awarding achievements based on user actions like logging in and completing quests.
*   **Quest System:**
    *   Implemented a foundational quest submission system, including a new `Quest` model, API routes (`/api/quests`), and a controller to handle quest logic.
*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `GET /api/achievements`: Fetches all available achievements.
    *   `GET /api/users/achievements`: Retrieves all achievements earned by the logged-in user.
    *   `POST /api/quests/:id/submit`: Allows users to submit solutions for quests, which triggers achievement checks.
*   **Database Seeding:**
    *   Created a seeder script to populate the database with a set of initial achievements, covering various categories (Milestone, Streak, etc.).

**Frontend Implementation:**

*   **Profile View:**
    *   Integrated a "Badge Showcase" section into the user's profile page, which dynamically displays all earned achievements.
*   **Quest View:**
    *   Created a new "Quest" view where users can see a list of available quests.
    *   Integrated the Ace code editor to allow users to write and submit their solutions.
*   **Real-time Notifications:**
    *   Implemented toast notifications to provide immediate feedback to the user when they unlock a new achievement.
*   **UI/UX:**
    *   Added new UI components and styled them with CSS to ensure a consistent look and feel with the rest of the application.

This completes the first phase of the implementation plan. The application is in a stable and working state. I am ready to proceed with the next phase: "Seasonal Events & Limited-Time Quests".
