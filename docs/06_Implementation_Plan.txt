1. ask for confirmation to check changes after each phase.
2. each stage should be fully working and without errors. 

## 1. Guiding Principles & Core Architecture

* **Performance, Security, Scalability** will drive all implementations.
* **Microservices Architecture**: Each feature (Guilds, Achievements, Store, Pets, etc.) will run as an independently deployable service.
* **Event-Driven Communication**: Services publish and subscribe to domain events (e.g., `quest.completed`, `badge.earned`) using RabbitMQ or Kafka.
* **Real-Time Layer**: A WebSocket-powered service will handle live updates for notifications, chat, leaderboards, and collaborative features.
* **Centralized API Gateway**: A single entry point to route traffic, enforce authentication, authorization, and rate limiting.
* **Database Strategy**:

  * Relational DB (PostgreSQL) for transactional systems (currency, store, guilds, mentorship).
  * NoSQL/Redis for caching, sessions, and flexible progress data.
  * Event logs for auditing and rollback capability.
